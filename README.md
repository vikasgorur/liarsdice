# Liar's Dice

Liar's dice is a gambling game played with dice. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_Dice) for details about the game.

This project is a simple HTML+JavaScript page that helps you figure out if a bid during the game is valid. See the [live demo](http://vikasgorur.github.com/liarsdice/liar.html)!
